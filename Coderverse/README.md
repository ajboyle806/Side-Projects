This folder contains code from a (past) stable version of Coderverse. The code is a tad messy but is being reorganized.

Coderverse is an interactive youth coding education app inspired by struggles that I faced while first learning how to program. In creating it, I felt that most coding apps for kids were either overcomplicated or oversimplified to the point of ineffectiveness, eagerly seeking to address a need I saw for an app that engagingly taught pre-secondary students actual coding languages. Presently it comprises a React front-end connected via Flask to a Python back-end and PostgreSQL database, though I am working to integrate the app with AWS to enable it to scale. I am hoping to create many more lessons and improve upon the functionality of the app's AI assistant system over the next few months
